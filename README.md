# Telegram Sticker Maker Bot

A Telegram bot that automatically process images and videos to meet Telegram's requirements for creating stickers and emojis in @Stickers. The bot maintains aspect ratios while resizing media to the correct dimensions and handles format conversion automatically.

This bot is designed with a session-based workflow: after choosing between sticker or emoji creation mode, it will continue processing all incoming media files in that mode until the user explicitly returns to the mode selection menu. This allows for efficient batch processing of multiple files without having to repeatedly select the desired output type.

If you find this project helpful, please consider giving it a star ‚≠ê It helps others discover the project and motivates further development.

## Branches
The bot has two versions available in different branches:
- `main` - Uses polling method to receive updates (recommended for development and testing)
- `webhook-version` - Uses webhook method to receive updates (recommended for production)

### Polling vs Webhook
- **Polling (main branch)**: 
  - Simpler to set up and debug
  - Works without public IP/domain
  - Suitable for development and testing
  - Higher resource usage due to constant requests

- **Webhook (webhook-version branch)**:
  - More efficient resource usage
  - Faster message processing
  - Requires HTTPS and public IP/domain
  - Better for production deployment
  - Supports dynamic webhook URL configuration

Choose the branch that best suits your needs before proceeding with installation.
